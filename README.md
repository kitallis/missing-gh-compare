# missing-gh-compare

GitHub has no easy way to access the very useful [diff / compare](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits) page. This extension adds the button (in the GH design language) to help you access it easily.

## Install

To install this extension, clone this repo and go to **about:debugging** â€” `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and load this extension.

## What

- Add a button to the top row of the repository navigation. This button will prompt you for a SHA, then open a new tab with the correct compare URL.
- By default, it will compare the entered SHA with the main branch.
- The compare will always be repository specific
