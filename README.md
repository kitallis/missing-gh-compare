GitHub has no easy way to access the very useful [diff / compare](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits) page. This extension adds the button (in the GH design language) to help you access it easily.

## Install

To install this extension,

- Clone this repo
- Go to <a href="about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" target="_blank">about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</a>
- Click on `Load Temporary Add-on...`
- Select any file from this repo
- You're done. Check your repo page.

## What

- Adds a "Compare SHA" button to the top row of the repository navigation.
- Enter just a SHA (e.g. `abc123`) to compare against `main`.
- Enter a SHA and branch (e.g. `abc123 master`) to compare against a different branch.
- The compare will always be repository specific.
